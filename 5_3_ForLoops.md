# Exercise 5-3: Iterating Through an Array in Gitpod

1. **Open Your Gitpod Workspace**: 
   - Ensure you're in your Gitpod workspace linked to your Java repository.

2. **Create a New Directory for the Package**: 
   - In the Gitpod interface (which is similar to VSCode), locate the File Explorer on the left sidebar.
   - Right-click on the directory where you want to add the new folder.
   - Choose "New Folder".
   - Name the folder `ex05_3_exercise`.

3. **Create a New Java Class Within the Folder**: 
   - Right-click on the newly created folder `ex05_3_exercise`.
   - Choose "New File".
   - Name the file `ShoppingCart.java`.

4. **Copy and Paste the Starter Code**:
   - Copy the provided starter code and paste it into the `ShoppingCart.java` file you just created.
   
   ```java

package ex05_3_exercise;

public class ShoppingCart {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // local variables
        String custName = "Mary Smith";
        String message;
        double price = 21.99;
        int quantity = 2;
        double tax = 1.04;

        String items[];
        items = new String[4];
        items[0] = "Shirt";
        items[1] = "Belt";
        items[2] = "Scarf";
        items[3] = "Skirt";
        
        message = custName + " wants to purchase "+items.length+" items.";
        System.out.println(message);
        
       // Iterate through and print out the items from the items array

        
    }    
}

```

5. **Iterate Through the `items` Array**:
   - After the line where the `message` is printed (i.e., `System.out.println(message);`), print the string "Items purchased: ".
   - Below that, create a for loop that iterates through the `items` array.
   - Within the loop, print each item from the array.

6. **Run and Test the Program**:
   - Save your file.
   - In the File Explorer, right-click on the `ShoppingCart.java` file.
   - Choose "Run Java".
   - Observe the output to see the list of items printed.
